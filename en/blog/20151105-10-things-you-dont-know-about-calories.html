                                                        <p>First, you need to know how many calories you're currently
                                                            consuming. You can figure that out by keeping a food journal:
                                                            tracking calories for everything you eat during a period
                                                            including at least two weekdays and one weekend day (since
                                                            people tend to eat differently on weekends). Figure out the
                                                            calorie count for each food item (see question 3), then tally
                                                            the total calories and divide by the number of days you tracked
                                                            your intake to find your daily average.</p>

                                                        <p>Or you can roughly estimate your caloric intake by using this
                                                            formula: If you are age 30 or under, multiply your weight by 6.7
                                                            and add 487; women who are 31-60 should multiply their weight by
                                                            4 and add 829. Then, multiply the total by 1.3 if you're
                                                            sedentary (don't work out at all), 1.5 if you're slightly active
                                                            (work out three to four times a week for one hour), 1.6 if
                                                            you're moderately active (work out four to five times a week for
                                                            one hour) or 1.9 if you're very active (work out almost every

                                                        <p>Once you know about how many calories you consume per day, try

                                                            chips. Bigger portions and excess calories at any time of the
                                                            day will pack on the pounds. Significant research shows that
                                                            eating a nutritious, low-calorie breakfast -- for example, a
                                                            bowl of whole-grain cereal topped with fruit and nonfat milk --

                                                            difference in how the calories are burned, but because you're
                                                            less likely to overeat later in the day if you start off with a
                                                            healthful meal.</p>
